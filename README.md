# MINI GEM lite: RTL Logic Simulator on GPU for Simple Circuits
 * Planned Workflow
1. Input

A small Verilog file (like an adder, MUX, or counter)  

Use Yosys to generate netlist or logic representation  

2. Convert to AIG

Focus only on basic logic gates (AND, NOT, DFF)  

3. Build CUDA Kernel

Write a GPU kernel that simulates logic updates  

Each GPU thread simulates a gate or a logic block  

4. Output

Show input/output transitions over simulated clock cycles  

Output data in CSV or waveform format

* Welcome to GEM
GEM is an open-source RTL logic simulator with CUDA acceleration, developed and maintained by NVIDIA Research.
GEM can deliver up to 5--40X speed-up compared to CPU-based leading RTL simulators.
A summary of the work with paper can be found [here](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2025-06_gem-gpu-accelerated-emulator-inspired-rtl-simulation).

## Compile and Run Your Design with GEM
GEM works in a way similar to an FPGA-based RTL emulator.
It first synthesizes your design with a special and-inverter graph (AIG) process, and then map the synthesized gate-level netlist to a virtual manycore Boolean processor which can be emulated with CUDA-compatible GPUs.

The synthesis and mapping is slower than the compiling/elaboration process of CPU-based simulators. But it is a one-time cost and your design can be simulated under different testbenches without re-running the synthesis or mapping.

**See [usage.md](./usage.md) for usage documentation.**
